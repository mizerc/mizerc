Hi there 👋

I’m a ~~senior software engineer~~ AI orchestrator software engineer based in Seattle, WA, with extensive experience building Web/Mobile applications and scalable API design.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, with an international education program in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin, USA.

My activity on this GitHub account is limited to personal projects, as I often use a separate account for fulltime work due to company policies.
